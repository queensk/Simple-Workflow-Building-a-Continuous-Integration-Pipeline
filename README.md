# Simple-Workflow-Building-a-Continuous-Integration-Pipeline

A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is a set of automated processes that are triggered when code changes are committed to a version control system. The pipeline typically includes tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the code.

To build a CI pipeline, you will need the following:

A version control system, such as Git.
A CI/CD tool, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI.
A build tool, such as Maven or Gradle, to compile and package the code.
A test framework, such as JUnit or Selenium, to run automated tests.
A deployment tool, such as Ansible or Puppet, to deploy the code to a staging or production environment.
The pipeline is typically configured to run whenever code is committed to the version control system. The pipeline will perform a series of tasks, such as building the code, running tests, and deploying the code to a staging or production environment. If any of the tasks fail, the pipeline will stop and alert the team.

It's important to note that the CI pipeline is just one step of the overall Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, which includes additional steps such as testing, staging and production deployment.
